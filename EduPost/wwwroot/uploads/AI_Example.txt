The small software projects they work on involve planning, gathering requirements and implementation phases within each sprint. The team stays organized by tracking their progress and addressing any issues that come up during sprint planning sessions and regular stand up meetings. Key Agile concepts, like sprint reviews and retrospectives play a role in creating a feedback loop that allows for adjustments and enhancements throughout the development cycle. By adopting this approach involving stakeholders from Green Groceries and System Concepts they ensure a shared vision and commitment, to success leading to an innovative e commerce development process.
